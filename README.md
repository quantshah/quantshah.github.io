# Shahnawaz Ahmed

I am Shahnawaz Ahmed, a Ph.D. candidate at the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology, Chalmers University of Technology, GÃ¶teborg. My research focuses on the intersection of quantum information, computing, and machine learning. I am interested in exploring the merger of these fields, with a particular emphasis on applying machine-learning techniques to solve problems in quantum physics.

I have written software for quantum simulations, neural networks that learn quantum state representations from data and collaborated on experiments to characterize quantum systems, and create non-classical quantum states of light (GKP and CAT states). I am passionate about open-source contributions and am actively involved in the team developing [QuTiP](www.qutip.org), the quantum toolbox in Python. Additionally, I have worked on [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai), where I have contributed to writing tools and tutorials that delve into Quantum Machine Learning.

In the past, I worked with Juan Carrasquilla at VectorAI and Nathan Killoran at Xanadu as a MITACS fellow. I did my master's thesis in the group of Prof. Franco Nori at Riken, Japan. I focused on developing numerical approaches to model open quantum systems during my time there.
