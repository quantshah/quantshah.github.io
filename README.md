# Shahnawaz Ahmed

I am Shahnawaz Ahmed, a Ph.D. candidate at the Wallenberg Centre for Quantum Technology, Chalmers University of Technology, GÃ¶teborg. My research focuses on the intersection of quantum information, computing, and machine learning. I am interested in exploring the merger of these fields, with a particular emphasis on applying machine-learning techniques to solve problems in quantum physics.

I developed adversarial neural networks for quantum tomography, a Riemannian optimization technique to speed up quantum process learning, and have written software for quantum physics and circuit simulations during my Ph.D. I have also collaborated with experimentalists to characterize quantum systems and create non-classical quantum states of light (GKP and CAT states). I am passionate about open-source software and am actively involved in the team developing [QuTiP](www.qutip.org), the quantum toolbox in Python. Additionally, I have worked on [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai), where I have contributed to writing tools and tutorials that delve into Quantum Machine Learning.

In the past, I worked with Juan Carrasquilla at VectorAI and Nathan Killoran at [Xanadu](http://Xanadu.ai/) as a MITACS fellow. I am collaborating with the quantum machine learning team at [Xanadu](http://Xanadu.ai/). I did my master's thesis in the group of Prof. Franco Nori at Riken, Japan, where I focused on developing numerical approaches to model open quantum systems and explored how deep neural networks can learn the rules of games such as Sudoku.
